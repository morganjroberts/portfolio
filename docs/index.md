# Hello!

Hello, I'm Morgan, an experienced med-tech engineer with a keen interest in hands on research and development. My journey includes a PhD focused on developing [open-source medical ultrasound hardware](./open-source-ultrasound.md) for breast cancer imaging, and my current role as a research fellow involves creating MRI-compatible hardware to explore the impact of focused ultrasound on brain activity.

Throughout my PhD, I excelled in acquiring a diverse skill set, spanning medical device design, software development, MRI and ultrasound physics, RF and digital electronics, mechanical design, manufacturing, and advanced data analysis. This demonstrates my passion for rapidly mastering new domains and tackling complex, multidisciplinary challenges.

Welcome to my website, a showcase of my professional and personal engineering projects. Enjoy exploring!
