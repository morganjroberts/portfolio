# Hello!

I'm Morgan, a medical research engineer with a passion for hands-on manufacture and experiments. I recently finished a PhD developing [open-source medical ultrasound hardware](./open-source-ultrasound.md) for breast cancer imaging, and now I work as a research fellow, building experimental setups to investigate how to change brain activity using focused ultrasound.

I am a confident generalist and thrive on using both my head and my hands to solve complex engineering problems.

This website is my portfolio of professional and personal engineering projects. Take a look around!
