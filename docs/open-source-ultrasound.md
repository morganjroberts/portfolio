# Open Source Ultrasound Imaging (PhD Project)

## Problem
Ultrasound tomography (UST) is a promising technique for breast cancer imaging. However, custom commercial UST hardware is manufactured using advanced equipment and so it is expensive.

## Solution
During my PhD I designed, manufactured and evaluated a low-cost, open-source ultrasound tomography system for medical imaging research.

I developed the open-UST transducer array to be manufactured using rapid prototyping, without specialist equipment. Extensive manufacturing documentation is available at **[morganjroberts.github.io/open-UST](https://morganjroberts.github.io/open-UST/)**:

## Impact
- The material cost was only Â£2k.
- The final manufacture time was 4 months.
- End users can also customise the transducer design to suit their research requirements.
- The system achieved very low interelement variation (<10 % standard deviation) in acoustic performance ([Ultrasound Transducer Characterisation](transducer-characterisation.md) for more details). This is vital for ensuring consistent and reliable imaging results.
- Despite its low cost, the open-UST system's acoustic performance is comparable with that of commercial systems, making it suitable for state-of-the-art image reconstruction methods.

This project is a **major step towards democratizing advanced ultrasound imaging technology**, especially for research institutions and healthcare providers with limited resources.
